##CSS for poems in EPUB and web

Poetry in publishing has often been an afterthought, so I created this repo for the purposes of bettering poetry in ebooks (and websites). The initial commit for this is the CSS I used for poetry in Strangelet. I hope to improve on this and expand it using SCSS. 

I was inspired to create this repo and make it public by a talk I heard in 2015 by Artie Moffa of Yellow Buick Press at Ebookcraft 2015.
